# BRACU-CSE-360-DATA-INTERFACING-_Lab-and-Project
In our course we had to do 2 projects. As in this pandemic it was not possible to do online projects , we had to do projects using software tools. We used LabVIEW,Arduino ino, 
virtual serial port,proteus etc. 
In our first project (Data Logger System), we mainly focused on measuring humidity and temperature. 
In our final project (LabVIEW Based Human Power Generator & Fitness Analyzer), our aim was to generate the power from spin bikes and also to measure the various parameters like heart rate, VO2 max level, battery status, power generated, speed etc. Here we used DC motor to represent the spin bike as we can't do hardware project in this pandemic.
